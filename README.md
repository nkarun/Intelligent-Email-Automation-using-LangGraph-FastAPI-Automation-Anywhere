# Intelligent-Email-Automation-using-LangGraph-FastAPI-Automation-Anywhere

📩 Intelligent Email Automation using LangGraph, FastAPI & Automation Anywhere
In today's customer support landscape, handling large volumes of emails efficiently while maintaining personalization and quality is a major challenge. To solve this, I built a smart email automation system that leverages:

🧠 LangGraph from LangChain for dynamic agent workflows

⚡ FastAPI as a lightweight API server

🤖 Automation Anywhere to interact with emails and trigger REST APIs

In this blog, I'll walk you through the architecture, workflow, and implementation of the project.

🧱 Project Architecture
Here’s a high-level view of the components:

📧 Email Inbox (Gmail/O365)
        ⬇️
🤖 Automation Anywhere Bot
        ⬇️ REST API Call
🚀 FastAPI (Python Backend)
        ⬇️
🧠 LangGraph Workflow

📤 Intelligent Email Response
💡 Why LangGraph?
LangGraph allows us to build stateful, multi-step workflows that can incorporate branching logic, loops, and memory — ideal for our email response generation use case. Instead of using a single LLM call, we're orchestrating a series of intelligent agents to:

Categorize emails

Retrieve relevant information

Draft professional responses

Proofread and validate the content

Send or retry based on quality

⚙️ Workflow Breakdown
1. Email Input via Automation Anywhere
Using Automation Anywhere, we created a bot that:

Connects to the email inbox

Reads new messages (subject + body)

Sends the email content to our FastAPI endpoint via a POST request

2. FastAPI: Gateway to the Workflow
python
Copy
Edit
@app.post("/Email")
async def process_email(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    subject = data.get("subject", "")
    body = data.get("body", "")

    state = {
        "subject": subject,
        "body": body,
        ...
    }

    graph_builder = Workflow(subject=subject, body=body)
    result = graph_builder.app.invoke(state)

    return {"data": result}
This endpoint initializes the LangGraph workflow with the incoming email content and returns a structured response.

3. LangGraph Workflow Logic
LangGraph lets us model the process as a state machine. Each email moves through the following nodes:

✅ Initialize_emails: Wraps subject/body into a custom Email object

🧠 categorize_email: Classifies email into product_enquiry, feedback, complaint, or unrelated

🔍 construct_rag_queries: Builds RAG queries based on content

📚 retrieve_from_rag: Uses vector search to get relevant knowledge base data

✍️ email_writer: Drafts the response using retrieved information

👀 email_proofreader: Verifies clarity, tone, and completeness

🔁 Retry logic if the email doesn’t meet standards

📤 Generated_email: Final, sendable response

All nodes are backed by powerful LLM agents using LLama3 via Ollama, or any LLM of your choice.

🔄 Conditional Logic & Loops
LangGraph shines with conditional edges and looping:

python
Copy
Edit
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "email_proofreader",
    nodes.must_rewrite,
    {
        "send": "Generated_email",
        "rewrite": "email_writer",
        "stop": "categorize_email"
    }
)
If the email is good → ✅ Send

If it needs improvements → 🔄 Rewrite

If we reach 3 trials → ⛔ Stop

This logic ensures quality control without manual intervention.

🧠 Agents (LLMs & RAG)
Here’s a quick overview of the agents:

Categorizer: Classifies intent using a prompt and structured output

RAG Query Generator: Translates email into 1–3 precise queries

Retriever: Queries a Chroma vector DB with nomic-embed-text

Email Writer: Drafts a polite, professional response

Proofreader: Verifies content and provides feedback

These are all built using LangChain's chaining and parsing tools, like PromptTemplate, ChatPromptTemplate, and with_structured_output.

🤖 Automation Anywhere Integration
Once the API is up and running, it's easy to plug in Automation Anywhere:

Use email automation package to fetch new emails

Extract subject and body

Use the REST Web Service action to call http://<your-server>/Email

Capture and handle the structured response (e.g., send it back to Gmail or log it)

This allows you to create a fully autonomous workflow without manual steps.

🔐 Security & Scaling
To make this production-ready:

✅ Use API authentication tokens

✅ Remove LLM key print() statements

🚀 Deploy with Gunicorn, Nginx, or serverless

📦 Use Docker for portability

📈 Add monitoring/logging (e.g., with Prometheus/Grafana)

🧩 Technologies Used
Tech	Purpose
LangGraph	Workflow management with LLMs
FastAPI	API layer for external communication
LangChain + Ollama	LLM orchestration and RAG
Chroma DB	Vector store for internal documents
Automation Anywhere	Email interaction & orchestration

🚀 Conclusion
By combining LangGraph's intelligent agent framework with FastAPI and Automation Anywhere, we built a powerful, modular, and scalable email automation system capable of reading, understanding, and replying to emails in a human-like, quality-controlled way.
